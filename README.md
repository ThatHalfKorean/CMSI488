Summary
=======
To the untrained ear (i.e. communications and history majors), describing a programming language aloud sounds like a foreign language. Derpodile is created with the intention of sounding like an idiot when you verbally describe your program, help you to make friends with these "high level users", and confuse your enemies. Inspired by general internet memes, along with associated spellings and onomatopeoias that indicate a lack of intelligence, Derpodile sounds dumb but has a powerful bite! This language is strongly and statically typed and is not intended for your average idiot.

**"Hello World" Example**

Ah, the classic "Hello, World" example. Even this masterpiece can be massacred with enough poor spelling and grammar. 

          pront "Hello, World" derp
          
In general, speaking in such a formal fashion is not the way of the derpodile. Throws off his groove, man. The following code is more appropriate for the average derp.

          pront "Halloh, wherlds" derp
          
Remember, try to sound like a 13 year old who is trying really hard to be funny but everyone wants him/her to be eaten by a crocodile. If you don't want to sound like a 13 year old, use JavaScript. No one is making you do this.

This one doesn't seem to be 13 yet, but probably still delicious.
